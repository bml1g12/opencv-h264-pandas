# opencv-h264-pandas
A build on pypy Python 3.6 with OpenCV that can write H264 video and has pandas installed 

With pypy at time of writing, it needs to compile pandas which is very time consuming, hence the desire for a prebuilt image.

The standard opencv python package cannot write H264 codec video, but this can.
